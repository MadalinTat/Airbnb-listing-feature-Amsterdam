# Aibnb-listing-feature-Amestrdam
A feature for Airbnb that shows the best listings for you based on the locations you are planning to visit in Amsterdam. Wouldn't it make sense to choose a place to stay in a location closest to where you're likely to go most often?

The app will show you the the listings that are less than 500 RON/night. (RON is my country's currency)

This project was created as part of my participation in Python for Data Science by Samir Sen on CoRise.
